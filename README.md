# CMSC389Q: iOS APP Development

## Course Description
This course provides a comprehensive, practical introduction to iOS mobile app development. We will be using the swift language along with the Xcode IDE to develop the applications following the MVC design pattern. In the beginning of the course we will begin by learning how to develop scalable user interfaces in the Xcode Interface Builder as well as controlling the interface using outlets. We will then progress by learning how to ingest and model data from a REST API and how to display this data to the user. Lastly, throughout the course we will be breaking down current iOS apps available on the app store and learning how we can create the same application. By the end of the course, we hope students are capable of developing and publishing their own apps to the Apple app store.

## Grading
Grades will be maintained on the CS Department
[grades server](https://grades.cs.umd.edu/).

You are responsible for all material discussed in lecture and posted on the
class repository, including announcements, deadlines, policies, etc.

Your final course grade will be determined according to the following
percentages:

| Percentage | Title | Description |
| ------------- | -----|-------- |
| 40% | Weekly HW  | Weekly assignments that can take the form of small projects or ELMS quizzes. |
| 20% | Midterm | An individual project where you create your own app using topics and features learned from previous lectures   |
| 25% | Final Project | An iOS app that uses everything you've learned in the semester. You may work in groups on this. |

Any request for reconsideration of any grading on coursework must be submitted
within one week of when it is returned. No requests will be considered
afterwards.

## Assignments/Projects
Assignments must be submitted electronically following the instructions given in
each project assignment. Assignments may not be submitted by any other means
(e.g., please do not email your projects to us). It is your responsibility to
test your program and verify that it works properly before submitting. All
projects are due at 11:59 PM on the day indicated on the project assignment.

Projects may be submitted up to 24 hours late for a 10% penalty. If you submit
both on-time & late, your project will receive the maximum of the
penalty-adjusted scores. You may submit multiple times.

Unlike lower-level programming classes, we will not provide you with test cases
(e.g., public tests) before projects are due. You will be responsible for
developing your own tests and for using appropriate testing techniques. Also,
we expect your projects to use proper style and documentation.

## Outside-of-class communication with course staff
We will interact with students outside of class in primarily two ways: online at [Piazza](piazza.com/umd/spring2018/cmsc389q/home) and office hours.
Tamer Office Hours: TBD or by appointment
Travis Office Hours: TBD or by appointment
Email should only be used for emergencies and non-class related questions
(e.g. projects).

## Academic Integrity
Note that academic dishonesty includes not only cheating, fabrication, and
plagiarism, but also includes helping other students commit acts of academic
dishonesty by allowing them to obtain copies of your work. In short, all
submitted work must be your own. Cases of academic dishonesty will be pursued to
the fullest extent possible as stipulated by the
[Office of Student Conduct](http://osc.umd.edu/OSC/Default.aspx).

It is very important for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating,
fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. For more information on the Code of
Academic Integrity or the Student Honor Council, please visit
