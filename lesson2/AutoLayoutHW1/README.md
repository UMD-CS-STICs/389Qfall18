For this assigment, we will be creating a mock bank view UI. The design is included as an image in the Screenshots folder. Just try your best to mock this layout in your storyboard!

What to submit:
Package this directory as a zip and then submit to the submit server.
So, the important parts in this folder are:
1. Your Xcode project
2. There is a Screenshots folder. In here, include 2 screenshots of your finished app, one running on the iphone X and the other on the iphone SE.

Some concepts that will be helpful in completing the project:

1. Placing views within views, and constraining them relative to their superview
2. Setting the height of a view = ratio * height of the superview (or screen height)
3. Setting the x,y positions relative to the superview's trailing/bottom spaces
